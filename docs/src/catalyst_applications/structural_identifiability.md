# [StructuralIdentifiability Analysis](@id structural_identifiability)
During parameter fitting, parameter values are inferred from data. Identifiability is a concept describing to what extent the identification of parameter values for a certain model is actually feasible. Ideally, parameter fitting should always be accompanied with an identifiability analysis of the problem. Identifiability can be divided into *structural* and *practical* identifiability. Structural identifiability considers only  the system and what quantities we can measure to determine which quantities can be identified. Practical identifiability instead considers teh available data, and determines what system quantities can be infeed from it. Generally, in the hypothetical case of an infinite amount of without noise, practical identifiability becomes identical to structural identifiability.
