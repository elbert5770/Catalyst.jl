### Stability Analysis ###

"""
    stability(u::Vector{T}, rs::ReactionSystem, p; sparse=false, ss_jac = steady_state_jac(u, rs, p; sparse=sparse), t=Inf, non_autonomous_war=true)

Compute the stability of a steady state (Returned as a `Bool`, with `true` indicating stability).

Arguments:
    - `u`: The steady state for which we want to compute stability.
    - `rs`: The reaction system model for which we want to compute stability.
    - `p`: The parameter set for which we want to compute stability.
    - `sparse=false`: If we wish to create a sparse Jacobian for the stability computation.
    - `ss_jac = steady_state_jac(u, rs; sparse=sparse)`: It is possible to pre-compute the Jacobian used for stability computation using `steady_state_jac`. If stability is computed for many states, precomputing the Jacobian may speed up evaluation.
    - `t=Inf`: The time point at which stability is computed. 
    - `non_autonomous_war=true`: If the system is non-autonomous (e.g. a rate depends on t), a warning will be given. Set this to false to remove that. Alternatively, specify a nonInf value for `t`.

Example:
```julia
# Creates model.
rn = @reaction_network begin
    (p,d), 0 <--> X
end
p = [:p => 1.0, :d => 0.5]

# Finds (the trivial) steady state, and computes stability.
steady_state = [2.0]
steady_state_stability(steady_state, rn, p)
```

Notes:
    y states (each being a `Vector`) is provided as `u`, stability is computed for each state separately.

"""
    steady_state_jac(rs::ReactionSystem; u0=[], sparse=false)

Creates the Jacobian function which can be used as input to `steady_state_stability`. Useful when a large number of stability computation has to be carried out in a performant manner.
 
Example:
```julia
# Creates model.
rn = @reaction_network begin
    (p,d), 0 <--> X
end
p = [:p => 1.0, :d => 0.5]

# Creates the steady state jacobian.
ss_jac = steady_state_jacobian(rn)

# Finds (the trivial) steady state, and computes stability.
steady_state = [2.0]
steady_state_stability(steady_state, rn, p; ss_jac)
```

Arguments:
    - `rs`: The reaction system model for which we want to compute stability.
    - `u0=[]`: For systems with conservation laws, a `u` is required to compute the conserved quantities.
    - `sparse=false`: If we wish to create a sparse Jacobian for the stability computation.
